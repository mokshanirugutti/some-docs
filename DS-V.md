### **Social Network Analysis (SNA)**

Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a methodology for studying the relationships, interactions, and structures within networks of people, organizations, or entities. It combines graph theory, statistics, and data science to uncover patterns, measure influence, and understand network dynamics.

### **Core Concepts in SNA**

1. **Nodes (Vertices)**:  
   - Represent individuals, groups, or entities in a network.  
     *Example*: People on a social media platform.

   - Represent the relationships or interactions between nodes.  
     *Example*: Friendships, followers, or collaborations.

3. **Graph Types**:  
   - **Directed Graphs**: Relationships have direction (e.g., following on Twitter).  
   - **Undirected Graphs**: Relationships are mutual (e.g., friendships on Facebook).  
   - **Weighted Graphs**: Edges have weights, representing the strength of the relationship (e.g., frequency of communication).

4. **Metrics in SNA**:
   - **Degree Centrality**: Measures the number of direct connections a node has.  
     *Application*: Identifying influencers.  
   - **Betweenness Centrality**: Measures how often a node acts as a bridge in the shortest path between two other nodes.  
     *Application*: Identifying key intermediaries.  
   - **Closeness Centrality**: Measures how quickly a node can access other nodes.  
     *Application*: Evaluating network efficiency.  
   - **Eigenvector Centrality**: Measures a node's influence based on its connections to other influential nodes.

### **MapReduce Architecture**

MapReduce is a programming paradigm and distributed processing framework that allows the processing of large-scale data sets across clusters of computers. Its architecture is based on two primary functions: **Map** and **Reduce**. The framework is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and efficient for big data processing.


### **Key Components of MapReduce Architecture**

1. **Input Data**:  
   - The large dataset is divided into smaller, manageable chunks called splits.  
   - Typically stored in a distributed file system like **HDFS** (Hadoop Distributed File System).

2. **Map Phase**:  
   - Each split is processed by a **Mapper** function.  
   - Mapper processes the input data and converts it into intermediate key-value pairs.  
   - **Example**: If the input is a text file, the mapper may count the occurrence of each word, outputting key-value pairs like `(word, 1)`.

3. **Shuffle and Sort Phase**:  
   - The intermediate key-value pairs are grouped by key.  
   - The system sorts the data so that all values associated with a specific key are grouped together.  
   - **Example**: For the key `word1`, all instances `(word1, 1)` are grouped.

4. **Reduce Phase**:  
   - The grouped data is passed to a **Reducer** function.  
   - Reducer performs aggregation, summarization, or other operations on the grouped data.  
   - **Example**: Summing up the values for `word1` to calculate its total count.

5. **Output**:  
   - The final output is written to the distributed file system in a structured format.  
   - This output can be directly consumed or passed to another system for further processing.


### **Advantages of MapReduce**

1. **Scalability**:  
   - Handles petabytes of data by leveraging distributed computing.

2. **Fault Tolerance**:  
   - Ensures task recovery in case of node or hardware failures.

3. **Ease of Use**:  
   - Abstracts complex parallel programming tasks, allowing users to focus on the logic.

4. **Flexibility**:  
   - Suitable for diverse use cases like log processing, data transformations, and machine learning.



### **Technologies Using MapReduce**

1. **Hadoop**:  
   - A popular open-source framework implementing the MapReduce paradigm.

2. **Apache Spark**:  
   - A faster alternative to MapReduce, performing in-memory computations.

3. **Google’s MapReduce**:  
   - The original implementation for indexing and processing massive datasets in search engines.
