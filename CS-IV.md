## Introduction to Password Cracking

Password cracking is the process of attempting to gain unauthorized access to a system by guessing or bypassing the password mechanism. This is usually done by attacking weak passwords, using brute force methods, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the system's authentication mechanism. Understanding password cracking methods helps in securing passwords and improving system security.

## Password Cracking Websites

There are various websites that provide tools and services to test password strength or crack passwords. These websites may use brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, or rainbow tables to break passwords. However, they should only be used ethically, for penetration testing or recovery of passwords for personal use.
Here is a list of websites commonly used for password cracking or testing password strength. 

1. **Have I Been Pwned**  
   Website: [https://haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com)  
   Allows you to check if your email or password has been involved in a data breach.

2. **CrackStation**  
   Website: [https://crackstation.net](https://crackstation.net)  
   A website that helps crack hashed passwords using precomputed hash tables.

3. **HashKiller**  
   Website: [https://hashkiller.co.uk](https://hashkiller.co.uk)  
   A platform that allows users to crack MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes.

4. **OnlineHashCrack**  
   Website: [https://www.onlinehashcrack.com](https://www.onlinehashcrack.com)  
   Offers paid services for cracking hashes and testing passwords against known datasets.

5. **Passware**  
   Website: [https://www.passware.com](https://www.passware.com)  
   Provides password recovery services and software tools for cracking encrypted files and passwords.

These websites use techniques such as brute-force, dictionary, and rainbow table attacks to attempt cracking passwords. Always ensure you're authorized to use these services to test systems.

## What is Password Guessing - How It Is Done

Password guessing involves trying different combinations of passwords until the correct one is found. Common methods include:
- **Brute Force**: Trying every possible combination until success.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Using a precompiled list of common passwords.
- **Hybrid Attack**: Combining both brute force and dictionary attacks.
- **Rainbow Tables**: Using a precompiled list of common passwords.

Attackers often use automated tools to speed up this process.

## Password Cracking Tools

Here are some commonly used password cracking tools:
- **John the Ripper**: A popular open-source password cracking software.
- **Hashcat**: Known for its speed and advanced capabilities in cracking hashed passwords.
- **Cain and Abel**: A Windows-based tool for password recovery.
- **Hydra**: A network login cracker that supports various protocols.

## Password Cracking Counter Measures

To prevent password cracking, you can take the following measures:
- **Use Strong Passwords**: Create long, complex passwords with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security, making it harder to crack passwords.
- **Account Lockout Mechanisms**: Lock accounts after several failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Password Hashing**: Store passwords in a hashed form using algorithms like bcrypt or PBKDF2.
- **Regular Password Changes**: Force users to change passwords periodically to reduce the risk.

## Escalating Privileges - Executing Applications

Privilege escalation is the act of gaining elevated access to resources that are normally restricted. This can be done in two ways:
- **Vertical Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges (e.g., from user to administrator).
- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation**: Accessing other users' resources without permission.

Attackers often use exploits, such as buffer overflows or misconfigured systems, to escalate privileges.

## Keyloggers

### Definition

A **keylogger** is a type of malware that records the keystrokes made on a computer or mobile device. It can capture sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, credit card details, and personal messages.

### Types

1. **Hardware Keyloggers**: Physical devices that are plugged into a computer to record keystrokes.
2. **Software Keyloggers**: Malicious software installed on a device that logs keystrokes.

### Popular Keylogger Attacks

- **Refined Keylogger Attacks**: These attacks involve advanced malware that hides its presence while capturing keystrokes.
- **Remote Access Keyloggers**: These allow attackers to access the logged keystrokes remotely.

### Counter Measures

- **Anti-virus/Anti-malware Software**: Use security software that can detect and remove keyloggers.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive information like passwords to prevent keyloggers from capturing them.
- **Use On-Screen Keyboards**: Use virtual keyboards to input sensitive information.

## Spyware

### Definition

**Spyware** is a type of malicious software designed to collect data from a computer or network without the user's consent. It can track user activities, collect personal information, and even modify system settings.

### Types

1. **Adware**: Displays unwanted ads or redirects to malicious websites.
2. **Trojan Horses**: Malware that masquerades as legitimate software to gain access to the system.
3. **System Monitors**: Tracks all system activities like browsing habits, file usage, and more.

### Popular Spyware Attacks

- **Browser Hijacking**: Spyware that alters the browserâ€™s settings and redirects users to malicious websites.
- **Keylogging Spyware**: Captures keystrokes to gather sensitive information.
- **Trojan-based Spyware**: Infects users through a legitimate-looking program or file.

### Counter Measures

- **Anti-spyware Software**: Regularly update and run anti-spyware programs to detect and remove spyware.
- **Security Updates**: Keep your operating system and applications up-to-date to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Avoid Suspicious Downloads**: Do not download files or programs from untrusted sources.
- **Use Firewalls**: Block unwanted outbound connections that spyware might attempt.
